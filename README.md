# Angular Test App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.
and modified for educational purposes.

Angular Test App is a single-page Angular web app. The contents of the /docs/ folder are built by Github Pages and deployed at `https://initial-b.github.io/`



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build Github Pages

Run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /Initial-B/` to build the project. The build artifacts (index.html, .js files) will be stored in the `/docs/` directory.
    - /docs/index.html must be edited with `<base href="./">` after build


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
